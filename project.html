  <p>To start of with my revisioning my hangman app I had to first think what i wanted and what I could do to make it more fun or enjoyable to the player. What I came up with was giving my the game a theme and adding some musics to it. While I was in the process of testing the music for the player it would not play when the app started up so what I decided to add a button to toggle the music on the opening page. Then for the other two pages it would start up with the music and when you clicked play again it would cut it. Then came my second challenge of making sure all the background images fit and could be seen by the player because why add a background for a theme if it can’t be seen and I fixed this by going into the advanced setting and fitting each image so they all fit. </p>
