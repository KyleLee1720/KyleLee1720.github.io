  Game Analysis
In this line of code we made a Quiz Game with most the questions set to be WW2 based. The basic of it is as soon as you click run a random shuffle function will randomize the ten question we imputed and print one of the ten but never repeat until you run the code again. Then it tells you to answer by putting A,B,C or D in caps if anything else is inputed it will tell you it is incorrect and let you try again until you get it correct.

<p>  

The purpose of the code we made was to make an educational game. Some problems me and my partner ran into during the making of this game is that the original code was not working the way we wanted it to in that it didn’t randomize the question which was a requirement. So I decided to make a new code that made it easier and more compatible to the random.shuffle code and that solved the problem of randomization of the questions. Then we ran into the problem of how are code wouldn’t allow to have four answers but there was an easy solution what we did is just have another answer input capability then we added the fourth answer. If we had more time I would have tried to randomize the answers so the question would be randomized and everytime you got the same question you can’t just remember were the answers are.
