<p> My Partner Daniel and I worked on making a Red-Light Green-Light Game 
using the Arduino software and Board. The component we used to build this includes, four RGB LED's, 1 IR Remote, 
and jumper wires. We faced many difficulties while making the baord, most 
of which carried relatively simple solutions. To start, we were going to begin 
with Red and Green LED's, but this would mean we could only use two of each.
That is, until we found out we could use RGB LED's, summing up to four LED's 
that would be the same colors all at the same time. Our biggest problem did not 
arrive until we began to impliment the IR Remote. Immediately after connecting
the Reciever to the circuit, it did not want to work. In fact, we began to smell 
a burnt smell witch mad me conclude to we were short circuiting it. We fixed that
but still nothing was showing that the reciever was working. And so we decided to 
unplug the whole board, and redo the wiring. We still met the same problem. It was 
until another day passed that we realized we left the IR remote untouched and implementing some code we figured out thats what it needed work.
. Now, knowing the Reciever works, my partner implemented the rest of the code while
rewired the board just so it would look more pleasing, and having done it three
times from the start it was pretty easy for to do from memory .Coding was quite easy, my partner had to 
write a code that would change the color of the LED depending on what number on the remote was pressed. 
If Button 1 is pressed, the LEDs would change Red. If Button 2 is pressed, the LEDs 
will change Green. </p>
