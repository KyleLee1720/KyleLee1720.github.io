<p> The career I strive to get is a mechanical engineer. This is no easy feat so to get me closer to this job i took the classes that will help me like the higher up maths and the engineering curriculum at school. I also practice with my cousin who is a successful mechanical engineer so I can get a good visual of the job and what is required of me if I do become one.There have been times when I stay in the garage working on a personal project from 10AM-9PM. My main Reason For wanting to become an mechanical engineer is because I have always loved drawing up designs then making them which event led me to go for this job.</p>
<p> The attributes needed for this and most jobs is perseverance. No matter if you fail in doing what you want the real challenge is will you rise up from your mistakes and take in what you learned to try again. I have failed many times in my life whether it be building my computer or my grades but I have never once thought to myself that I failed myself and in doing so instead of focusing on the past I was able to improve I can now build my own Pc with no trouble and get good grades. If I always did everything right I wouldnâ€™t have a lot of the life experience I gained from my mistake and improve.</p>
<p> Currently at the age of 16 I have been able to travel almost all over the United States and Europe looking at many different colleges. Being able to see all the colleges and their mechanical displays has been a great experience that just wants me to strive further to get the job I want. Just last year I was able to see a new foldable solar panel which was one of the most interesting things to me a solar panel that can fold itself is amazing at the same time it was able to generate a good amount of power. The words my friends describe me is a thrill seeker or an adventurer and explorer they also would also call me crazy for the things I do but inside everyone has a little bit of craziness that is good.</p>
<p> In conclusion I am a adventurer that wants to gain some more experience in my life before the high school ends. When college come I want to be ready for it and start my life as an adult. </p>
