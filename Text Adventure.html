<h2>Written Response</h2>
<p>
	Before I go into the creation of this game I would like to clearly state that this wasn’t a single man project I had a partner that had the same if not more creative ideas and work as me so I’d like to credit him for some of the work Christopher Thorpe my creative partner making the creation of the game way more fun. So now that we credited my copartner let's get into the creation of this game. We started by coming up with an idea for are story and for some reason we thought of the great depression which brought us to the idea of making monopoly our theme. Then we came up with a rough backbone of the story that we both agreed on we made it into a quick flow chart witch gave us a step by step of what needed to be coded in order . Then all that's left was coding the game and making adjustments to the story were we both could agree. One of the many problem we ran into was there was a lot of lines of codes that wouldn’t run and it would be because a single misspelled word or lack of a apostrophe so what we came up with was as soon as on of us finished our part of the code we would proofread each others making sure neither of us made a mistake so maybe if one of us couldn’t see the mistake the other one could.
